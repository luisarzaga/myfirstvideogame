# myfirstvideogame
The purpose of this project was to learn how to program with python the basics of a videogame using pygame and put my pixel art skills into an environment. I tried combining both my programming skills and my art skills together and form a basic videogame that I will be changing through time as I learn more about pixel art illustration and python programming.
